## Overview

Data protection is a fundamental legal and ethical obligation. Contentious probate matters involve sensitive personal information requiring careful handling under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018.

---

## Legal Framework

### Key Legislation

**General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
- Applies from 25 May 2018 (retained in UK law post-Brexit)
- Sets principles for processing personal data
- Grants rights to data subjects
- Imposes obligations on data controllers
- Significant penalties for breach (up to £17.5m or 4% of global turnover)

**Data Protection Act 2018**
- UK implementation of GDPR
- Supplements GDPR
- Specific provisions for legal services

**Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR)**
- Regulates electronic marketing
- Cookie consent requirements

### Regulatory Guidance

**Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)**
- UK supervisory authority
- Issues guidance and codes of practice
- Investigates complaints
- Imposes penalties

**Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA)**
- SRA Standards and Regulations require compliance with data protection laws
- Professional duty of confidentiality overlaps with data protection

---

## Key Definitions

### Personal Data

**Definition:**
Information relating to an identified or identifiable living individual

**In Contentious Probate Includes:**
- Client's name, address, contact details
- Beneficiaries' details
- Family members' information
- Medical information about deceased (if relates to living individuals)
- Financial information
- Witness information
- Correspondence

**Note:** Information about deceased persons is NOT personal data under GDPR (deceased have no data protection rights). However:

- Professional courtesy and client confidentiality still apply
- Family members may be data subjects

---

### Special Category Data

**Definition:**
Personal data revealing:
- Racial or ethnic origin

---

### Data Controller

**Definition:**
Entity determining purposes and means of processing

**In Practice:**
- Your law firm is the data controller
- Responsible for GDPR compliance
- Liable for breaches
- Must implement appropriate safeguards

---

### Data Processor

**Definition:**
Entity processing data on controller's behalf

**Examples:**
- IT service providers
- Cloud storage providers
- Transcription services
- Document scanning services
- Counsel (may be processor or joint controller)

**Requirements:**
- Written contract (data processing agreement)
- Processor must provide sufficient guarantees
- Specific contractual terms required by GDPR

---

## GDPR Principles

### Six Key Principles

Personal data must be:

**1. Lawfully, Fairly, and Transparently Processed**
- Lawful basis for processing
- Inform data subjects how data will be used
- No hidden processing

**2. Collected for Specified, Explicit, and Legitimate Purposes**
- Clear purpose for collecting data
- Don't use for incompatible purposes
- In legal practice: providing legal services, complying with legal obligations

**3. Adequate, Relevant, and Limited (Data Minimization)**
- Only collect necessary information
- Don't collect "just in case"
- Review what data you actually need

**4. Accurate and Up to Date**
- Take reasonable steps to ensure accuracy
- Correct inaccurate data promptly
- Allow data subjects to update their information

**5. Kept No Longer Than Necessary (Storage Limitation)**
- Retention schedules
- Delete/destroy when no longer needed
- Balance with other legal obligations (professional indemnity, limitation periods)

**6. Processed Securely (Integrity and Confidentiality)**
- Appropriate technical and organizational measures
- Protect against unauthorized processing, loss, destruction
- Security proportionate to risk

---

## Lawful Basis for Processing

### Six Lawful Bases (GDPR Article 6)

**For Contentious Probate, Typically:**

**1. Legitimate Interests (Article 6(1)(f))**
- Your firm's legitimate interest in providing legal services
- Must conduct balancing test (interests vs data subject's rights)
- Document your assessment

**2. Contract (Article 6(1)(b))**
- Processing necessary to perform contract with client
- Taking steps at client's request before entering contract

**3. Legal Obligation (Article 6(1)(c))**
- Compliance with legal obligations (e.g., money laundering regulations, court orders)
- Professional conduct requirements

**Less Common:**

**4. Consent (Article 6(1)(a))**
- Not typically relied upon for legal services
- Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous
- Can be withdrawn
- Avoid relying on consent for essential processing

**5. Vital Interests (Article 6(1)(d))**
- Rarely applicable in legal context

**6. Public Task (Article 6(1)(e))**
- Not applicable to private law firms

---

### Special Category Data

**Requires BOTH:**
- Lawful basis under Article 6 (above), AND
- Condition under Article 9

**Article 9 Conditions (Commonly Used):**

**Explicit Consent (Article 9(2)(a))**
- Higher standard than regular consent
- Must be explicit
- Document carefully

**Legal Claims (Article 9(2)(f))**
- Processing necessary for establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims
- Most relevant for contentious probate
- Covers litigation and pre-litigation

**Substantial Public Interest (Article 9(2)(g) + DPA 2018)**
- Various conditions in DPA 2018 Schedule 1
- May apply to legal services

---

## Client Information and Consent

---

### Consent (When Required)

**When Needed:**

**Valid Consent Requires:**
- Freely given (real choice, no detriment for refusal)
