## Using the File Index

### Physical Files

**Setup:**
1. Create divider tabs for each main division (A-G)

3. Label clearly and consistently
4. Use color-coding if helpful (e.g., red for Court Documents, blue for Evidence)

**Filing:**
- File documents in correct division immediately
- Maintain chronological order within each section
- Use separator sheets for related document groups
- Never mix divisions

**Maintenance:**
- Review and tidy file weekly
- Remove duplicates
- Ensure all documents properly labeled with date and description
- Update index when structure modified

---
