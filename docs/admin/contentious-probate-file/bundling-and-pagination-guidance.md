# Bundling and Pagination Guidance - Contentious Probate

<!-- This document provides comprehensive guidance on preparing court bundles for contentious probate matters -->

## Purpose

To establish standards for preparing, paginating, and organizing court bundles in contentious probate matters, ensuring compliance with court requirements and best practices.

---

## General Principles

### Court Requirements

**Court bundles must:**
- Be properly paginated with continuous numbering
- Have clear index with page references
- Be in ring binders (not spiral bound or stapled)
- Use dividers between sections
- Be legible (no poor photocopies)
- Not exceed reasonable size without permission
- Be filed/served by deadlines

### Purpose of Bundles

- **Trial bundle:** All documents for trial
- **Hearing bundle:** Documents for interim hearing/CMC
- **Disclosure bundle:** Disclosed documents
- **Authorities bundle:** Case law and statutes
- **Core bundle:** Key documents (large cases)

---

## Pagination

### Continuous Numbering

**All pages must be numbered continuously:**

```
1, 2, 3, 4, ... 347, 348, 349
```

**NOT:**
- Section-based (A1, A2, B1, B2)
- Chapter numbering (1.1, 1.2, 2.1)
- Restarting at each section

### Pagination Method

**Bottom center or bottom right of each page**
- Clear, legible numbers
- Not obscuring text
- Same position throughout
- Machine or hand numbering acceptable

### Pre-Numbered Documents

**If document already has numbers (e.g., letter on firm paper):**
- Add bundle page number separately
- Do not obscure original numbering
- Usually in different location

### Exhibits to Witness Statements

**Two approaches:**

**Option 1: Include in main bundle**
- Exhibit pages numbered continuously
- Reference in witness statement to bundle pages
- Example: "See pages 125-137 of the bundle"

**Option 2: Separate exhibit bundle**
- Each exhibit separately paginated
- Referenced by exhibit number
- Less common in contentious probate

**Recommended: Option 1** for ease of reference

---

## Index Preparation

### Index Format

**Index must include:**
- Section/Tab letter
- Document description
- Date of document (if known)
- Page number(s)

### Example Index

### Index Best Practices

- Clear descriptions (not just "Letter")
- Consistent formatting
- Accurate page references
- Enough detail to identify document
- Check accuracy before finalizing

---

## Physical Bundle Preparation

### Ring Binders

**Use:**
- Lever arch files for large bundles
- 2-ring or 4-ring binders
- Adequate capacity for documents
- Strong, good quality binders

**Do NOT use:**
- Spiral binding
- Stapled bundles
- Folders without rings
- Binders too small for contents

### Dividers

- **Clearly labeled** with section letter/number
- **Card dividers** (not paper)
- **Tabbed** for easy access
- **Protrude** beyond pages
- **Color-coded** if helpful

### Document Preparation

**Before including documents:**
- Remove staples and paperclips
- Flatten folded documents
- Ensure all pages present
- Replace illegible pages with better copies
- Enlarge small print if necessary

### Legibility

- **Clear, readable** copies
- **No dark/faint copies**
- **Enlarge** if original is small print
- **Clean copies** (no stray marks)
- **Color copies** if color is important (e.g., photos, highlighted plans)

### Hole-Punching

- **Standard 2 or 4 holes**
- **Careful** not to obscure text
- **Repair** torn holes before filing
- **Reinforcers** for important pages prone to tearing

---

## Electronic Bundles

### When Required

- Court may order electronic bundle
- Remote hearings typically require
- May be in addition to or instead of hard copy
- Check court's specific requirements

### Format

**Usually:**
- Single PDF file (or separate PDFs per section)
- Hyperlinked index (click to jump to page)
- Bookmarks for each section/document
- Searchable text (OCR if scanned)
- Reasonable file size (compress if large)

### File Naming

```
Claim-Number_Trial-Bundle_Volume-1.pdf
HC-2025-000123_Trial-Bundle_Vol-1.pdf
```

### Hyperlinking

**Index should link to documents:**
- Click on page number to jump to document
- Bookmarks/navigation pane for sections
- Test all links before serving

---

## Bundle Sizes

### Page Limits

**General guidance:**
- Single trial bundle: up to 350 pages
- If exceeding 350 pages: multiple volumes
- Seek court approval for very large bundles

### Multiple Volumes

**If necessary:**
- Volume 1: Pleadings, Orders, Key Documents
- Volume 2: Witness Statements
- Volume 3: Exhibits, Other Documents

**Each volume:**
- Clearly labeled (Volume 1 of 3)
- Continuous pagination across all volumes
- Single index covering all volumes (in Volume 1)

---

## Special Considerations

### Medical Records

- **Chronological order**
- Clear identification of source (GP, hospital, etc.)
- Consider separate section or volume
- May need expert's assistance in selection

### Plans and Photographs

- **Enlargements** if necessary for clarity
- **Color copies** if color is significant
- **Fold-out** pages if large (but can be problematic)
- Consider **separate folder** for very large items

---

## Post-Hearing

### After Hearing/Trial
