## Overview

---

## Legal Framework

### Key Rules and Guidance

**Civil Procedure Rules:**
- CPR Practice Direction 32 (Evidence) - Annex (Trial Bundles)
- CPR Practice Direction 39A (Miscellaneous Provisions Relating to Hearings)

**Court Guides:**

- Business and Property Courts Guide

**Specific Orders:**

---

## Bundle Principles

### Core Principles

1. **Court-Focused**: Bundle serves the court's needs first
2. **Accessibility**: Easy navigation and document location
3. **Completeness**: All relevant documents included
4. **Accuracy**: Correct and legible documents
5. **Agreement**: Index agreed with opponent where possible
6. **Compliance**: Meets all court requirements and deadlines

---

## Responsibility for Bundles

### Who Prepares

**Default Position (CPR PD 32 Annex):**

### Timing

## Pagination

### Pagination Method

**Standard:**
- Number pages consecutively from start to finish
- Use Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, not i, ii, iii)
- Place page number in bottom right corner
- Use permanent marker/stamp (not Post-It notes)

**Format:**
- Single number: 1, 2, 3...
- Not sub-divided by section
- Continuous throughout all volumes

**Multiple Volumes:**
- Volume 1: pages 1-300
- Volume 2: pages 301-600
- Volume 3: pages 601-900

### Pagination Process

**Manual Pagination:**
1. Assemble all documents in order
2. Number each page in bottom right
3. Use page numbering stamp or hand numbering
4. Be neat and legible
5. Don't obscure text

**Automated:**
- Some photocopiers can auto-paginate
- PDF software can add page numbers
- Check all pages numbered correctly
- Ensure numbers don't obscure content

### Special Situations

**Blank Pages:**
- Number but mark "Blank page"
- Don't skip numbers

**Documents Already Numbered:**
- Renumber for bundle (don't rely on original numbers)
- Original page numbers may be noted in index if important

**Large Documents:**
- Consider extracts only if whole document unnecessary
- Explain in index: "Extract - pages X-Y of original"

---

## Indexing

### Index Format

**Essential Elements:**
- Document description
- Page number (or range)
- Date of document (if applicable)

**Sample Index Entry:**
```
Section C - Statements of Case
1. Claim Form                                   1
2. Particulars of Claim dated 15 Jan 2025     3
3. Defence dated 20 Feb 2025                   15
```

### Index Detail Level

**Document Description:**
- Specific enough to identify document
- Include date for correspondence and statements
- Include author/recipient for letters
- Include witness name for statements

**Examples:**
```
✓ Letter from Claimant's solicitor to Defendant dated 10 Dec 2024  23
✓ Witness statement of John Smith dated 5 Jan 2025                 45
✓ Will of deceased dated 15 June 2020                              67

✗ Letter                                                            23
✗ Witness statement                                                45
✗ Will                                                             67
```

### Sub-Sections

**Organize Logically:**
- Section A: Preliminary
- Section B: Statements of Case
- Section C: Orders
- Section D: Witness Statements
  - D1: Claimant's witnesses
  - D2: Defendant's witnesses
- Section E: Experts
- Section F: Documents

**Numbering:**
- Letter for main section
- Number for sub-section (optional)
- Continuous pagination regardless

- Ring binders for thinner bundles
- Secure binding that lies flat

**Dividers:**
- Use tab dividers for main sections
- Label clearly
- Color-coding optional but can help

**Spine Labels:**
- Case name (abbreviated if necessary)
- Claim number
- Volume number (if multiple)
- "Trial Bundle" or "Hearing Bundle" and date

**Example Spine Label:**
```

Volume 1 of 3
For Trial: 15-17 April 2025
Claimant
```

- Flat-lying pages

**Practicality:**
- Not too heavy (split into volumes if >300 pages)
- Easy to handle and navigate
- Robust for courtroom use

---

## Multiple Volumes

### When to Split

**Split into multiple volumes when:**
- Single volume exceeds 300-350 pages
- Bundle too heavy/unwieldy
- Logical divisions exist (e.g., evidence vs documents)

### Volume Organization

**Option 1 - Sequential:**
- Volume 1: Sections A-C (pages 1-300)
- Volume 2: Sections D-E (pages 301-600)
- Volume 3: Section F (pages 601-750)

**Option 2 - Thematic:**
- Volume 1: Pleadings and Orders
- Volume 2: Evidence (witness statements and experts)
- Volume 3: Documents

**Labeling:**
- Clear volume numbers: "Volume 1 of 3"
- Spine shows page range: "Pages 1-300"
- Master index in Volume 1 shows which volume contains which sections

---

## Electronic Bundles

### E-Bundles

**Increasingly Common:**

- Some courts mandate electronic format
- Others permit hybrid (electronic + limited paper)

**PDF Format:**
- Single PDF per volume
- Searchable text (OCR if scanning)
- Hyperlinked index (if possible)
- Bookmarks for main sections

**File Size:**
- Compress images to reduce size

- Split if too large

**File Naming:**
```
Smith_v_Jones_HC2024001234_TrialBundle_Vol1.pdf

```

### Uploading/Delivery
