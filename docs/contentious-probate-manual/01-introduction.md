## What is Contentious Probate?

   Dependants) Act 1975

## Common Issues

### Standing to Bring Claims

Not everyone has the right to bring contentious probate claims. Standing depends on:

- The type of claim being brought
- The claimant's relationship to the deceased
- Whether the claimant has a financial interest in the estate

### Time Limits

Different types of claims have different time limits:

- **Inheritance Act claims**: 6 months from grant of representation
- **Validity challenges**: No strict time limit, but delay can affect relief
- **Proprietary estoppel**: Subject to laches doctrine

### Costs

Costs in contentious probate can be complex:

- Estate usually bears costs of reasonable validity challenges
- Family provision claims follow normal civil litigation costs rules
- Special costs rules may apply in certain circumstances
