## Drafting Guidance

### Style and Content

**DO:**
- Write in first person ("I saw..." not "The witness saw...")
- Use numbered paragraphs
- One fact per paragraph (generally)
- State facts, not opinions (unless expert)
- Be specific about dates, times, places
- Quote conversations directly where possible
- Explain how you know each fact
- Identify documents clearly
- Maintain chronological order
- Use plain English
- Be complete but concise

**DON'T:**
- Include legal argument (save for submissions)
- Give opinions unless you're an expert
- Include speculation or assumptions
- Make statements beyond your knowledge
- Include hearsay without identifying source
- Contradict your earlier statements without explanation
- Include irrelevant material
- Use unnecessarily formal or archaic language

### Common Issues to Avoid

1. **Lack of specificity:** Avoid vague statements like "around that time" - be as specific as possible
2. **Hearsay without identification:** If information came from someone else, say who and when
3. **Inconsistency:** Ensure statement consistent with pleadings and other evidence
4. **Over-elaboration:** Keep it factual and relevant
5. **Missing exhibits:** All documents referenced must be exhibited
6. **Poor organization:** Maintain clear structure and chronology
