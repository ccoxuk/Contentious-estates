    c) Failed to make adequate attendance notes of instructions.

---

#### [OPTION B: WANT OF KNOWLEDGE AND APPROVAL]

### WANT OF KNOWLEDGE AND APPROVAL

15. The Claimant contends that the Disputed Will is invalid because the Deceased did not know and approve its contents.

16. There are suspicious circumstances surrounding the preparation and execution of the Disputed Will which raise a doubt as to whether the Deceased knew and approved its contents.

**PARTICULARS OF SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES**

17. The suspicious circumstances include:

18. In the premises, the burden rests on the Defendant as propounder of the Disputed Will to prove affirmatively that the Deceased knew and approved its contents.

19. The Defendant will be unable to discharge that burden because [summarize why - e.g., "there is no evidence the Deceased read the will / the Deceased's understanding was compromised / the circumstances show the will reflected [beneficiary's] wishes not the Deceased's"].

---

#### [OPTION C: UNDUE INFLUENCE]

### UNDUE INFLUENCE

    d) [Dependence on [Name] for [care / accommodation / financial support / social contact]]

    e) [Making threats to the Deceased: [specify]]

    f) [Exploiting the Deceased's dependence and vulnerability: [specific examples]]

19. The undue influence amounted to coercion of the Deceased's will such that the will executed on [date] did not represent the Deceased's true wishes but rather the wishes of [Name] imposed upon the Deceased.

20. But for the undue influence of [Name], the Deceased would [not have made a will in this form / would have made provision in accordance with [his/her] previous will / would have provided for [the Claimant] as [describe]].

**PARTICULARS OF TESTAMENTARY PROVISION**

21. The Disputed Will [gives the whole/majority of the estate to [Name] / disinherits the Claimant who was previously a beneficiary / makes provision inconsistent with the Deceased's previously expressed intentions].
