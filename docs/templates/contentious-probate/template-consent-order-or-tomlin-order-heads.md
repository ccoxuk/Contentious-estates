## Guidance Notes

### When to Use Consent Order vs. Tomlin Order

**Use Consent Order when:**
- Terms are straightforward
- No need for confidentiality
- All terms can appropriately be made public

**Use Tomlin Order when:**
- Confidentiality is required
- Complex payment terms over time
- Multiple stages of implementation
- Contains commercially sensitive terms
- Includes non-monetary obligations

### Key Drafting Points

1. **Clarity:** Ensure all terms are clear and unambiguous
2. **Completeness:** Cover all aspects of settlement
3. **Enforceability:** Make terms capable of enforcement
4. **Timing:** Specify all deadlines precisely
5. **Contingencies:** Address what happens if terms not met
6. **Tax:** Consider tax implications and include appropriate provisions
7. **Approval:** Ensure all parties approve exact wording

### Special Considerations

**Protected Parties (Children/Patients):**
- Court approval required
- Justification for settlement needed
- May need evidence (e.g., counsel's opinion)
- Consider need for statutory will or trust

**Estate as Party:**
- Ensure executor has authority to settle
- Consider other beneficiaries' interests
- May need notice to all interested parties
- Consider whether settlement binds all beneficiaries

**Tax Implications:**
- Consider IHT, CGT, income tax
- Take specialist tax advice
- Document tax treatment if agreed
- Consider HMRC clearances if needed

**Implementation:**
- Build in time for conveyancing, probate, etc.
- Identify who does what and when
- Consider need for stakeholder until completion
- Address risk of non-completion
