# Form N1 - Claim Form

## Purpose

Form N1 is the standard claim form used to start most types of civil claims in the County Court
and High Court in England and Wales.

## Use in Contentious Probate

Form N1 may be used to commence:

1. **Inheritance Act 1975 claims**: Applications for reasonable financial provision
2. **Validity challenges**: Claims disputing the validity of a will based on:
   - Lack of testamentary capacity
   - Lack of knowledge and approval
   - Undue influence
   - Fraudulent calumny
   - Forgery
3. **Construction claims**: Seeking court interpretation of will provisions
4. **Proprietary estoppel claims**: Claims based on promises or representations

## Completing Form N1

### Key Sections

- **Claimant details**: Name and address of the person bringing the claim
- **Defendant details**: Name and address of the person being sued (e.g., executors, beneficiaries)
- **Brief details of claim**: Short statement of what the claim is about
- **Value of claim**: Estimated value (may be stated as "Cannot be quantified")
- **Particulars of claim**: Can be included or attached separately

### Contentious Probate Considerations

When using Form N1 for contentious probate claims:

1. **Defendants**: Usually include the executors and interested parties (beneficiaries)
2. **Value**: Often difficult to quantify precisely; state approximate estate value if relevant
3. **Court fee**: Based on claim value or estate value
4. **Particulars of claim**: Should clearly set out:
   - The deceased's details
   - Date of death
   - Details of the will (if any)
   - The basis of the claim
   - Relief sought

## Related Forms

- **N208**: Acknowledgment of Service
- **N244**: Application Notice (for interim applications)
- **N260**: Statement of Costs (summary assessment)

## Procedural Notes

- Must be accompanied by appropriate court fee
- Should be served on defendants within 4 months of issue (or 6 months for service abroad)
- Particulars of claim may be served separately within 14 days of service of claim form
- Consider CPR Part 57 (Probate and Inheritance) practice direction requirements
