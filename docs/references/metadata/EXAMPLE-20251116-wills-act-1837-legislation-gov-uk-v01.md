# Summary

The Wills Act 1837 is the principal statute governing the making, execution, and revocation of wills in England and Wales. It sets out the formal requirements for a valid will, including that the testator must be at least 18 years old (with exceptions for privileged wills), the will must be in writing, signed by the testator, and witnessed by two independent witnesses.

The Act has been amended multiple times, most significantly by the Administration of Justice Act 1982, which reformed the rules on attestation and introduced section 20 (rectification of wills) and section 21 (interpretation of wills).

# Key Provisions

## Section 7 - Age and Mental Capacity
- No will made by any person under the age of eighteen shall be valid
- Exception for privileged wills (e.g., soldiers, mariners)

## Section 9 - Requirements for Execution
- Will must be in writing and signed by the testator (or by some other person in the testator's presence and by their direction)
- Signature must be made or acknowledged by the testator in the presence of two or more witnesses present at the same time
- Each witness must attest and sign the will (or acknowledge their signature) in the presence of the testator
- No form of attestation required
- Witness need not see contents of will

## Section 15 - Gifts to Witnesses (and Spouses)
- If a beneficiary (or their spouse/civil partner) witnesses the will, the gift to them is void
- The will itself remains valid
- Does not apply to creditors witnessing wills in which debts are charged on property

## Section 18 - Revocation by Marriage
- Marriage revokes a will (with exceptions introduced by subsequent legislation)

## Section 18A-18C - Divorce and Nullity
- Added by Administration of Justice Act 1982
- Effect of divorce/dissolution on wills

## Section 20 - Revocation by Destruction
- Will revoked by burning, tearing, or otherwise destroying with intention to revoke
- Must be by testator or by another person in testator's presence and by their direction

# Updates and Amendments

## Major Amendments

### Administration of Justice Act 1982
- Reformed section 9 (execution requirements)
- Added sections 18A-18C (divorce/nullity)
- Introduced section 20 (rectification) - NOTE: This section 20 is in the AJA 1982, not the Wills Act 1837
- Introduced section 21 (interpretation) - NOTE: This section 21 is in the AJA 1982, not the Wills Act 1837

### Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989
- Section 1 amended formal requirements for execution of deeds, which affected wills

### Civil Partnership Act 2004
- Extended spouse provisions to civil partners

### Succession to the Crown Act 2013

## Current Status
The Act remains in force as the primary legislation governing wills in England and Wales. Practitioners should always refer to the current consolidated version on legislation.gov.uk to ensure they have the most up-to-date text including all amendments.

## Practice Points
- Section 9 requirements are strictly interpreted - failure to comply renders will invalid
- Common issues in contentious probate: presence of witnesses, acknowledgment of signature, testator's signature placement
- Attestation clause not required but provides evidential weight
- Beneficiary-witnesses: void gift but valid will - consider remedies under I(PFD)A 1975
