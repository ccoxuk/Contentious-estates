# Ilott v Mitson and others [2017] UKSC 17

## Case Summary

This landmark Supreme Court case concerned a family provision claim by an adult estranged
daughter who had been left nothing in her mother's will.

The Supreme Court's decision provides important guidance on the application of the Inheritance
(Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975, particularly regarding claims by adult children.

## Key Facts

- The claimant was the deceased's only child
- Mother and daughter had been estranged for 26 years
- The deceased left her entire estate (£486,000) to three charities
- The claimant had limited means and was dependent on state benefits
- The claimant had five children

## Supreme Court Decision

The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the charities' appeal and restored the trial judge's award
of £50,000 (instead of the Court of Appeal's award of £143,000).

## Key Principles

1. **Maintenance Standard**: For adult children, the test is "reasonable financial provision for
   maintenance" not full provision as for a spouse.

2. **Objective Assessment**: The court must objectively assess what provision is reasonable,
   considering all circumstances.

3. **Section 3 Factors**: Proper weight must be given to all factors in s.3 of the 1975 Act,
   including:
   - Financial resources and needs
   - Obligations and responsibilities
   - Size and nature of the estate
   - Any physical or mental disability
   - Any other matter, including testamentary freedom

4. **Testamentary Freedom**: The principle of testamentary freedom remains important and should
   not be lightly overridden.

5. **No Windfall**: The Act is designed to provide for reasonable maintenance needs, not to give
   a "windfall" or to provide for every wish or aspiration.

## Impact

This case has significant implications for:

- Family provision claims by adult children
- The balance between testamentary freedom and family provision
- Assessment of "reasonable financial provision for maintenance"
- The weight given to different factors under section 3
