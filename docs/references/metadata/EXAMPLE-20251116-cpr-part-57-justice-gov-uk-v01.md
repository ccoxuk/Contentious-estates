# Summary

CPR Part 57 sets out the procedural rules for:
1. **Probate claims** (Section I) - Claims concerning the validity of a will or for revocation of a grant
2. **Claims under the Inheritance Act 1975** (Section II) - Family provision claims
3. **Presumption of death and dissolution of marriage** (Section III) - Applications for declarations of presumed death

## Current Practice

### Interaction with Part 8
Many probate and inheritance claims use Part 8 alternative procedure:

- Construction claims
- Uncontested family provision claims

### Interaction with Practice Direction 57
PD 57 provides essential detail on:
- Required documents
- Form of statements of case
- Evidence requirements
- Listing arrangements

## Practice Points

### Probate Claims
1. **Standing** - Only persons with interest can challenge
2. **Pleadings** - Must particularize grounds (lack of capacity, undue influence, etc.)
3. **Evidence** - Contemporaneous medical evidence crucial for capacity challenges
4. **Costs** - Consider Kostic v Chaplin principles for costs from estate

### Inheritance Act Claims
1. **Time limits** - Strict 6-month limit from grant (but extendable)
2. **Standing** - Must fall within category of eligible applicants (s.1)
3. **Two-stage test** - (1) Reasonable financial provision? (2) If not, what order?
4. **Evidence** - Full financial disclosure required from applicant and estate

### Tactical Considerations
1. **Part 8 vs Part 7** - Choose procedure carefully based on factual disputes
2. **Early ADR** - Court expects pre-action engagement and ADR
3. **Security for costs** - Consider in probate claims by non-beneficiaries
4. **Interim provision** - Available in Inheritance Act claims pending final hearing

### Common Issues
1. **Service** - Ensuring all interested parties are served
2. **Standing caveat** - Interaction with caveat procedure (non-contentious)
3. **Discovery** - Limited in probate claims unless ordered
4. **Consolidation** - Multiple claims may be consolidated
